TailSafety Version 46 Enhancements

Enhancements from previous version (V41 to V46):

1.  Replaced the install-on-import mechanism in g2p.py with a clear RuntimeError, improving security and user experience.
2.  Implemented a robust voice profile fallback in main.py, preventing a KeyError when the voices directory is empty.
3.  Corrected the Q factor calculation for iirpeak in src/engine.py, using the correct center_freq / bandwidth formula for accurate DSP.
4.  Parameterized the sample rate (fs) in the numba function generate_formant_waves_jit, removing a hard-coded value.
5.  Fixed stress parsing and punctuation handling in src/engine.py's parse_text method for more consistent text processing.
6.  Hardened audio playback in src/engine.py's speak method using a context manager and error handling for sounddevice.
7.  Added validation for required voice profile keys in src/engine.py's TailSafetyEngine.__init__ for better configuration safety.
8.  Added a basic unit test file (tests.py) to validate core engine functionality.
9.  Updated the main program's startup message to be cleaner and more user-friendly.
10. Implemented new command structure: /voices for listing, 'voice <num/name>' for switching, and /log for future debug logging.
